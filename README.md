# BatSquirrelExemple

This is the example project for the plugin BatSquirrel for [Unreal Engine 4](unrealengine.com).

The plugin is made to make you able to script your Unreal Engine 4 project by using the [Squirrel language](squirrel-lang.org).
You will have to expose yourself what can be used.

It is inspired of [LuaMachine](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/luamachine).
